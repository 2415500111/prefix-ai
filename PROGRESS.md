# Prefix AI — Build Progress

Each phase gets a short plan before work starts. Tick a phase only when lint, type-check, all tests, and `docker compose build` pass, then record the date and a 2–3 line summary (see "Git workflow" in CLAUDE.md).

## Resume point

**Status:** Phases 0–1 merged and pushed to https://github.com/2415500111/prefix-ai. CI added on `main`.
**Next:** Phase 2 (Data model + Auth/RBAC) on branch `phase-2-data-model-auth`.

**Docker verification runs in CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `docker compose build`, then `up --wait`, migrations and health checks), because the dev machine has no container runtime. If Docker is installed locally later, run `make up && make migrate && make health` locally too.

  Verified: 17 pytest + 3 Vitest passing, ruff/mypy strict/ESLint/tsc/Prettier clean, web production build OK, API `/health` OK over HTTP.
  Docker build and compose smoke test: verified in CI.
